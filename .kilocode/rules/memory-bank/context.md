# Current Context

## Work Focus
- Roll out the production specification section in the budget form through feature flags
- Stabilize the specifications API and analytics instrumentation for the new fields
- QA budget and order workflows to confirm persistence and validation of production specs

## Recent Changes (Latest Updates)
- **Production Specifications Integration**: `BudgetForm` now mounts `ProductionSpecificationsSection` with eight legacy fields, conditional logic, and analytics hooks
- **Specifications Delivery**: `/api/specifications` serves JSON-backed options with admin POST support and the `useSpecifications` hook handles caching plus fallbacks
- **Validation & Business Rules**: `BudgetSchema` adds enum-based validation, capa rules, and pricing tolerances while feature flags gained presets and persistence helpers
- **Instrumentation**: `analytics.ts` captures specification usage, validation errors, abandonment, and performance metrics gated by the analytics flag
- **Documentation Alignment**: `docs/BUDGET_CORRECTION.md` and `docs/MIGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` outline the migration path and confirm no database changes are required
- **Feature Flag Utilities**: Development presets toggle all production-related flags for QA and store overrides in localStorage for quick testing sessions

## Next Steps
- Run regression tests pre-release and enable `PRODUCTION_SPECIFICATIONS` plus `ENHANCED_VALIDATION` in staging
- Clean UTF-8 issues in specification JSON and fallback data before turning the feature on for users
- Add automated coverage for the specifications API, budget form validation, and analytics triggers
- Plan follow-up work on enum tables and indexing once adoption metrics justify Phase 2 data modeling
