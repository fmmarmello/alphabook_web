# Current Context

## Work Focus
- Authentication performance optimization: ✅ COMPLETED
- Budget-to-order constraint system implementation: ✅ COMPLETED
- System is production-ready with comprehensive workflow validation and optimized authentication

## Recent Changes (Latest Updates)
- **Authentication Performance Optimization**: Eliminated double token validation across API routes, improving overall API performance and reducing unnecessary database queries
- **Database Schema Enhancement**: Enhanced Prisma schema with new enums (BudgetStatus, OrderStatus, OrderType), proper foreign key relationships between Budget-Order-Client-Center models, and comprehensive audit trail implementation
- **Budget Workflow API System**: Complete budget workflow APIs implemented (/submit, /approve, /reject, /convert-to-order) with state machine validation and role-based permissions (MODERATOR/ADMIN required)
- **Order Status Management**: New order status change API with business logic validation and state machine constraints
- **Navigation System Upgrade**: Real-time navigation counts API for pending budgets and active orders with role-based visibility
- **Enhanced Frontend Components**: Budget and order forms updated with client/center selection, workflow management dialogs, and status change capabilities
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Added column visibility controls to data tables with reusable components and extracted shared logic for better maintainability
- **Security Enhancements**: Prevented HSTS header in development to avoid redirect loops and improved server-side authentication helpers
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: 36 tests across 5 scenarios covering API endpoints, database integrity, business rules, performance validation, and security controls
- **Migration System**: Safe data migration scripts created for budget model enhancements
- **Documentation Structure**: Updated documentation organization with comprehensive memory bank initialization and removed deprecated documentation files

## Next Steps
- System is production-ready and fully functional with optimized authentication
- Consider implementing notification system for budget approvals
- Monitor performance metrics and user adoption in production environment
- Continue iterative improvements based on user feedback
