# DEPRECATED - Zero-Trust Authentication Architecture Design

This document has been **DEPRECATED** as it describes a future zero-trust architecture that has been largely implemented in the current system.

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE**
- ✅ Every request authenticated via middleware
- ✅ Multi-layer security (authentication + authorization + validation)
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Audit logging in place
- ✅ Session management active

**Current Zero-Trust Features:**
- Never trust, always verify (all requests authenticated)
- Least privilege access (role-based permissions)
- Defense in depth (middleware + API + database security)
- Comprehensive request validation

For current authentication architecture documentation, see `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
