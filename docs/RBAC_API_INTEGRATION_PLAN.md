This document has been **DEPRECATED** as it describes integration plans for RBAC features that are already successfully integrated into the API layer.

**Integration Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented (`src/lib/rbac.ts`)

- ✅ Permission system with USER/MODERATOR/ADMIN hierarchy
- ✅ Field-level security with `getFieldSelection()`

- ✅ Standardized error handling with `ApiAuthError`

**Current RBAC Features:**
- Complete role hierarchy enforcement
- Resource-level access controls
- Field-level data filtering
- Permission-based authorization
- Ownership validation

For current RBAC architecture documentation, see `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
